Category theory primarly focuses on relations among objects, not the objects themselves.

\begin{definition}
A \emph{category} \( \cat{C} \) consists of:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
  \item A class \( \Ob(\cat{C}) \) of \emph{objects},
  \item For each pair \( A, B \in \Ob(\cat{C}) \), a set \( \Hom_{\cat{C}}(A, B) \) of \emph{morphisms} (also called \emph{arrows}) from \( A \) to \( B \),
\end{itemize}
such that composition of morphisms and identity morphisms are defined and satisfy associativity and unit laws.
\end{definition}
