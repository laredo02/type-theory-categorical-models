\section{\centering Untyped \lCalc}

\\
In order to get acquainted with the \lcalc, let us develop a simple example to familiarize ourselves before we begin with a more formal approach to this discipline. Consider the function $f(x) = x + 1$, the most straightforward way to express this using \lcalc \ would be $(\lambda x . x + 1 )$, \footnote{ This example abuses notation in the pursuit of understanding, the \lcalc \ only allows expressions of the form defined in \ref{def:lambda-terms} } where the lambda denotes that $x$ is being captured and used as a parameter to perform some computation. Evaluating $f(2)$ using this newly created lambda term would look like this: $(\lambda x . x + 1)(2) \curly (2 + 1) \curly 3$. This process of reducing a \la-expression is referred to as \bred, it will be covered formally later in the chapter.

The set of lambda terms \( \Lambda \) is defined inductively as follows:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Variables:} If \( x \) is a variable, then \( x \in \Lambda \).
  
  \item \textbf{Abstraction:} If \( x \) is a variable and \( M \in \Lambda \), then \( (\lambda x. M) \in \Lambda \).
  
  \item \textbf{Application:} If \( M, N \in \Lambda \), then \( (M\ N) \in \Lambda \).
\end{itemize}

Another concept that might be worth-while glancing over, is what in the jargon is referred to as first-class citizenship, or more formally high-order. When we use high-order to refer to a \la-term, we refer to the fact that both functions and arguments are treated indistiguishably, the example below sheds some light on the matter:
\begin{align*}
  \overbrace { (\lambda f . \lambda y . f f y) }^{A} \overbrace{ (\lambda x . x + 1) }^{B} \overbrace{(2)}^{C}
  &\curly (\lambda y .(\lambda x . x + 1) (\lambda x . x + 1)y)(2) \\
  &\curly (\lambda x . x + 1)(\lambda x . x + 1)(2) \\
  &\curly (\lambda x . x + 1) (3) \\
  &\curly (4)
\end{align*}
Taking a closer look, $A$, applies $f$ twice to $x$, as a consequence, $B$ is being applied twice to $C$. And so, very easily, we have implemented the $ x + 2 $ function via a sequential application of $x + 1$ to $C$. One can intuitively apreciate the computational expresivenes this brings with it, and how the sintactic-semantic homogeneity sets the \lcalc \ apart from the classical set-theoretic approach to functions.

\subsection{\centering
  Lambda Terms}

Having established a basic intuition behind the lambda calculus, let us begin to formalize the basic notions that e


define $\mathbb{V} = \{x, y, z, ...\}$, as the set of all possible variable names, a set of little real importance, but a must-have in order to formalize some of the upcoming definitions.
\begin{definition} \textbf{($\mathbf{\Lambda}$; The Set of all $\mathbf{\lambda}$-terms)}: The language for expressions in the lambda calculus can be defined using a grammar in BNF notation like this:
  \label{def:lambda-terms}
  \[
    M = x \mid MM \mid \lambda x . M \quad x \in \mathbb{V}
  \]
\end{definition}
\begin{example} Some examples of valid $\lambda$ terms that belong to $\Lambda$:
  \( y \),
  \( \lambda x. x x \),
  \( \lambda x. \lambda y. x \),
  \( (\lambda x. x x) (\lambda y. y) z \).
\end{example}
\begin{definition} \textbf{(Sub; Multiset of Subterms)}: Since every lambda term is made up of other smaller lambda terms, it is only natural to define the set of subterms:
\begin{align*}
  &\Sub x = \{x\} \\
  &\Sub {MN} = \Sub M  \cup \Sub N \cup \{MN\} \\
  &\Sub {\lambda x . M} = \Sub M  \cup \{\lambda x. M\}
\end{align*}
Where $x \in \mathbb{V}$ and $M, N \in \Lambda $.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition} \textbf{(Proper Subterm)}: A term $M \in \Sub M, \ M \in \Lambda$ is said to be proper if $S \neq M$. Thus, $\Sub{M} \setminus \{M\}$ would be the multiset of proper subterms.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition} \textbf{(Var; The set of Variables in a lambda term)}:
\begin{align*}
    & \FV x = {x}\\
    & \FV {MN} = \FV M \cup \FV {N} \\
    & \FV {\lambda x . M} = \FV M \setminus \{x\}
\end{align*}
\end{definition}
\begin{definition} \textbf{(FV; The set of Free Variables in a lambda term)}: Variables that are not captured by means of an abstraction are said to be free, non-free variables are said to be bound.
\begin{align*}
    & \FV x = {x}\\
    & \FV {MN} = \FV M \cup \FV {N} \\
    & \FV {\lambda x . M} = \FV M \setminus \{x\}
\end{align*}
\end{definition}
\example{ Compute the free variables of $\lambda x . \lambda y . y x z$:
    \begin{align*}
        \FV {\lambda x . \lambda y . y x z} &= \FV {\lambda y . yxz)} \setminus \{x\} \\
        &= \FV {yxz} \setminus \{x, y\} \\
        &= \{x, y, z\} \setminus \{x, y\} \\
        &= \{z\}
    \end{align*}
    Of course, $z$ is the only free variable in the expression as it is the only variable that is not captured by some lambda abstraction.
}

\begin{definition}
  A term $M \in \Lambda$ is closed if and only if $\FV M = \emptyset$, closed lambda terms are often referred to as combinators. $\Lambda^0$ is the set of all closed lambda terms.
\end{definition}

\subsection{\centering Fixed Point Combinators and Recursion}


\section{\centering Simply Typed \lCalc}

The Untyped Lambda Calculus in computationally equivalent to a  Turing machine. However, with great computational power comes limited decidability of properties, leading to non-termination, or expressions such as $x(\lambda y . y)$, whose meaning is unclear.

A classic example of non-termination is the $Y$ combinator, however, the Simply Typed Lambda Calculus does not allow such expressions, as its type system is unable to assign a valid type to them.

To understand why, consider the role of function types: in the world of functions, a function maps values from a domain to a range. The Simply Typed Lambda Calculus enforces this structure explicitly, ensuring that every function application is well-typed and preventing self-application patterns that would lead to paradoxes or infinite loops.

Having grasped the untyped lambda calculus's Turing completeness and ability to compute all computable functions, we now seek properties related to decidability. To this end, we introduce the simply typed lambda calculus. Although it possesses less computational power than its untyped counterpart, it offers attractive features regarding decidability that will be useful later on.
